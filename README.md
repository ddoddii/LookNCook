![lookncook_page-0001](https://github.com/gdsc-ys/LookNCook/assets/95014836/50fbe0d7-69e2-4793-9d6c-aa40f7a42e1a)


## ðŸ’¡ What is LookNCook ?

Have you ever considered the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals as they age?
Vision loss, impacting over 90% of sensory input, can decrease physical activity and heighten health risks for aging individuals, making maintaining a healthy diet even more crucial.

However, cooking independently can be difficult for them.
Our solution, **LookNCook, empowers visually impaired seniors to cook for themselves and supports their health.**

### ðŸŽ¯ Our SDG Goals and target

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gdsc-ys/lookncook-server/assets/95014836/30d9dad1-b88a-420e-a808-0dceb5eaa7ef">

- **Goal 2: No Hunger**
- **Goal 3: Good health and well-being**
- **Goal 10: Reduced inequality**

We aimed to achieve Goal 10: Reduced Inequality by supporting elderly individuals with visual impairments to cook in the kitchen just as easily as those without disabilities.

In particular, we focused on the common issue of inadequate nutrition among elderly individuals with visual impairments. By recommending recipes tailored to the user's age and basic health situation,
we sought to achieve Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being and ultimately target 2.2 of Goal 2: No Hunger, which is to end all forms of malnutrition.
